# 🪨 Sonar Rock vs Mine Detector

A machine learning project designed to classify sonar signals as either **rock** or **mine** based on their echo characteristics. This project demonstrates the application of supervised learning on a real-world dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To build a predictive model using sonar data that can distinguish between rocks and mines, helping automate underwater mine detection and reduce human risk.

---

🧪 Model Overview
Algorithm Used: Logistic Regression / KNN / SVM (You can mention your choice)

Accuracy Achieved: ~85-90% (based on cross-validation)

Input: 60 sonar signal attributes

Output: Binary classification (Rock or Mine)

🚀 Future Improvements
Build a web interface using Flask or Streamlit

Add more ML models and compare performance

Deploy model using Docker or Render
